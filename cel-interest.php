            Céline
        </h2>
        <p class="cel-interest__text">Céline was originally created as a made-to-measure children's shoe business that eventually grew into women's shoes and accessories.[2] The ready-to-wear line debuted in the 1960s. Celine Vipiana was the designer from 1945-1997.</p>
        <p class="cel-interest__text">On September 4, 2008, the influential fashion portal WWDFashion announced that Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, appointed Phoebe Philo as the new creative director of Céline. Philo started at Celine in October 2008 and presented her first Céline ready-to-wear collection for Spring/Summer 2010 at Paris Fashion Week to rave reviews.[citation needed] Philo replaces Ivana Omazić, who, according to LVMH, failed to transform the brand into an essential flagship of worldwide prêt-à-porter.[citation needed] “By giving Philo Céline, we’re giving her a platform to express her vision,” said Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive officer of LVMH’s fashion division which owns Céline.</p>
